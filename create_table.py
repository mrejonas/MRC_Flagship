# Script to create table columns taking existing CSV or Excel
# table headers as input
# Reason: more often than not, tables already exist for existing
# projects. Trying to create the table headers manually is and
# EXTREME pain. The need is there for a script that will take
# the existing headers and create REDCap data instruments just
# given this table header CSV
